# Introduction to terrain and foot placement IK solving

---



- Foot placement IK is the ability of the animated character to make the body and legs block any blocking terrain and adjust the entire pose programatically, in a natural and believable manner. Normally one will need to make use of Unreal's default solvers such
as the two-bone IK and FABRIK solvers to get foot placement, but it is often a very tedious process that rarely gives best results without diving into C++.

- DragonIK got you covered, as the plugin provides a quick,efficient and painless way to bring foot placement ability to majority of your characters. Whether it is humans,quadrupeds,spiders or even snakes, the plugin makes it possible. Keep your character blueprints clean, and
get powerful foot placement IK working with just 2 animation blueprint nodes.
