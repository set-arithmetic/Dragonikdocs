Lower maximum dip height works better for spiders (usually). Enable "alternate cross based rotation" to use the cross-shaped 4 trace lines to determine the rotation of the pelvis
during slopes. The 4 trace lines uses the alternate trace radius for spacing. Tweak the rotation intensities for the right results.

Copy/Paste the "dragon input data" from the spine solver to foot solver .

Increase "trace height below" so legs can reach the ground more prematurely. Useful to have it a higher value when idle, and a lower value when in locomotion.
